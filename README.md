# Friendly Birds - a not so angry birds clone
This was my journey into Angry Birds. I focused on the following components:

+ Camera System for PIXI
+ Minimap View on the scene
+ Box2D Integration in PIXI (there is some code from Phaser's Box2D)
+ Fluid Integration (Liquid Fun), the build of box2d already contains liquid fun (see <a href='https://github.com/google/liquidfun/releases'>here</a> 
+ Polygon Rendering in PIXI (this wasn't possible then)
+ Custom Water Shader for the particles
+ Raycasting in Box2D
+ Building a Slingshot with Trajectory projection

**ðŸ‘»Attention. This is old code. Very manual. Require JS, no npm versioning. ðŸ‘»**
